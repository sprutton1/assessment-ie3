# Infrastructure Engineer 3 Take-Home Assessment

This is the repository for the System Initiative Infrastructure Engineer III take-home assessment. It is designed to verify that:

* You have proficiency in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines
* You have proficiency in deploying a containerized application

We use a take-home assessment so that you can have your most productive environment at hand. Use whatever editor, operating system, etc. you like. Google to your heart's content. 

Please spend no more than 4 hours on this assessment. 

## What you'll be doing

We created a fake company called Taskly, and you’ve been hired as the first Infrastructure Engineer! Taskly is a new company that’s reinventing the task list, and the engineering team has been busy working toward a beta-launch. They’re ready to get this product into the world and start getting feedback! We want you to build a CI/CD pipeline that deploys Taskly into a cloud environment.  

Taskly is split into two components - a `frontend` and a `backend`. Each component has its own README with information about the components, including full instructions on how to run it (including link checks and automated tests).

To get started, [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). If you prefer, you can make your fork private and add `britmyerss`,
`fnichol`, `stack72`, and `mahirl` as collaborators. When you've finished, let us know
via email, with a link to your fork. We'll review it and get back to you!

Have fun!


## How you'll be building it

Your implementation should, at minimum, include: 

* running lint checks
* tests
* building each component as a container image
* running those containers in the cloud

We want you to use whatever tools and cloud provider you’re most comfortable with. However, please stick to the free tiers or use mock APIs, as we don’t want you paying anything out of pocket for this! 

We also want you to include a README, that tells us how you’ve designed your solution and how it works. 

Upon completion, we will fork your repo, open a pull request, and see your pipeline in action! 


# Good luck!

Thank you so much for taking the time to do the assessment. We're looking forward
to reviewing your work!
